# Webpack-2

*This serves as a step-by-step, intro to the Webpack module bundler*

## Getting Started
*The optimal way would be to work through this side-by-side, building your own repo*
1. Fork and/or clone this repo
2. `git branch -r` - to see the branches
3. Checkout to a branch
4. Build your own project via the instructions
5. Break something and fix it
6. Create a new empty branch, and rebuild as best as you can from memory
